### Further Imporvements
- Show loading animation when saving a pdf
- Add 2nd and 3rd template
- Customizable fonts and colors
- Use normal form instead of a modal
- Add remove button on the main page instead of the modal
- Responsiveness
- Fix list markers not showing up in the correct spot
- Fix console errors

### New Design Idea
- Sidebard contains controls for the pdf
example fonts, colors, orientation, quality, template
- Editing will be on the form itself. Text button changes to input form when you click on it
press enter to save and esc for canceling.
- If an input is already open and the user clicks on another button then save and close the previous one and open the one the user clicked on
